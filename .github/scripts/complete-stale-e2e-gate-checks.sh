# Manual cleanup for orphaned e2e-*-gate API checks on HEAD_SHA -- either
# still in_progress, or already (mis-)finalized by an earlier run of this
# same script.
#
# MODE=complete: mirror the orphan onto the native gate job's real terminal
#   conclusion (success, skipped, failure, or cancelled). An in_progress
#   unlock orphan keeps the required check pending, so merge queue stays on
#   Cancel pending even after native e2e already failed. Mirroring failure
#   cannot greenwash a broken PR; it only ends that wait. Do not use
#   dismiss once a native result exists -- a new cancelled check-run can
#   become the latest name and re-block a green PR.
# MODE=dismiss: cancel unlock-time orphans, but ONLY when the native gate
#   job has not posted a terminal result yet. Cancelling an orphan whose
#   native gate already completed can make that cancellation the *latest*
#   check-run for the name (required-status-check evaluation uses the most
#   recent entry per name), silently re-blocking a PR that was actually
#   fine -- confirmed this happening in practice: an earlier run of this
#   script in dismiss mode did exactly that after the real gate had already
#   succeeded hours earlier. Use MODE=complete instead once a native result
#   exists.
#
# Re-fetches check-runs immediately before each per-orphan PATCH decision
# (not just once at the top) so a gate that transitions state while this
# script is mid-run (e.g. a still-in-flight e2e suite finishes between the
# first gate's processing and the last) is judged on current data. This
# narrows, but by construction of the GitHub REST API cannot fully close,
# the gap between reading a check-run's state and PATCHing it -- a run
# could still change state in between those two calls for a given orphan.
