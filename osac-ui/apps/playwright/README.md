# @osac/playwright

Playwright browser tests for manually verifying `osac-ui` against a **live,
already-deployed** cluster — the running proxy, SPA, Keycloak realm, and
`fulfillment-service` backend all in one real environment.

This is not a CI suite. There is no mock server for `fulfillment-service`
and no way to run this hermetically — it exists for AI agents to manually confirm a
change actually works end-to-end against a real deployment, the way you'd
otherwise do by hand in a browser.

## Prerequisites

- A reachable `osac-ui` deployment (any HTTPS URL that serves it).
- A Keycloak user on that deployment's realm to log in as. This package
  doesn't provision one — use an existing test account, or create one on the
  target environment first.
- Playwright's browser binaries installed once per machine (see Setup below).

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @osac/playwright exec playwright install chromium
```

## Running

Required environment variables:

| Variable           | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OSAC_UI_BASE_URL` | Full URL of the `osac-ui` deployment to test, e.g. `https://osac-ui-<namespace>.<cluster-domain>` |
| `OSAC_USERNAME`    | Username of a Keycloak test user on that deployment's realm                                       |
| `OSAC_PASSWORD`    | Password for that user                                                                             |

```bash
export OSAC_UI_BASE_URL=https://... OSAC_USERNAME=...
read -rs OSAC_PASSWORD && export OSAC_PASSWORD   # avoids leaving the password in shell history
pnpm playwright
```

(`pnpm playwright` is a root-level shortcut for `pnpm --filter @osac/playwright
run playwright`.) None of these have defaults — each is required, so a missing
value fails immediately with a clear error instead of silently pointing at the
wrong environment. `pnpm playwright` logs in, runs the [smoke
test](#smoke-test), and runs every spec under `scratch/` — see [Writing a
test](#writing-a-test).

For iterating on a `scratch/` spec, logging in on every run is slow and adds a
real Keycloak request each time. Log in once, then re-run just the spec as
many times as you need, reusing the saved session:

```bash
pnpm playwright:setup   # logs in once, writes .auth/user.json
pnpm playwright:run     # runs scratch/ specs only, no login
pnpm playwright:run     # ...repeat as many times as you're iterating
```

`pnpm playwright:run` never re-authenticates — if `.auth/user.json` is missing
or the session has expired, re-run `pnpm playwright:setup` first.

Optional:

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS` | Set to `true` to trust self-signed/cluster-internal CA certs, common on dev and lab clusters. Off by default because this flow submits a real Keycloak password — it disables TLS verification for the whole browser context, not just `localhost`, so only enable it against clusters you trust. |

Testing against a local `pnpm dev` instance instead of a remote deployment:
requires `pnpm dev` running in another terminal, and still needs
`OSAC_USERNAME`/`OSAC_PASSWORD`.

```bash
export OSAC_UI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 OSAC_USERNAME=...
read -rs OSAC_PASSWORD && export OSAC_PASSWORD
pnpm playwright
```

The backing `fulfillment-service`/Keycloak for a local dev server is often a
dev/lab cluster with a self-signed or cluster-internal CA cert — the real
login redirect goes there even though the UI itself is on `localhost`, so if
you hit a TLS error, explicitly opt in with `IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS=true` rather
than trusting it by default:

```bash
export OSAC_UI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 OSAC_USERNAME=... IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS=true
read -rs OSAC_PASSWORD && export OSAC_PASSWORD
pnpm playwright
```

## How authentication works

`osac-ui` has no test-mode auth bypass — every login goes through a real
Keycloak realm via the app's normal OIDC flow. Rather than repeating that
flow (and Keycloak's own login page) for every test, this harness follows
Playwright's standard pattern for testing authenticated apps:

1. A `setup` project (`src/auth.setup.ts`) opens the app, which auto-redirects
   to Keycloak when unauthenticated, fills in `OSAC_USERNAME`/`OSAC_PASSWORD`
   on Keycloak's real login form, and saves the resulting browser session
   (cookies) to `.auth/user.json`.
2. Every real test (the `smoke` and `chromium` projects) declares a dependency
   on `setup` and loads that saved session before the test body runs — so
   tests start already logged in.

`pnpm playwright` (and `pnpm playwright:setup`) always re-run `setup` first,
regenerating `.auth/user.json` fresh. `pnpm playwright:run` skips `setup`
entirely and reuses whatever session is already on disk — see
[Running](#running).

`.auth/user.json` contains a live, real session (the actual `osac-access`
cookie) — it's gitignored and must never be committed or shared, and
`auth.setup.ts` restricts it to `0600` (and its directory to `0700`) so other
local accounts on a shared machine can't read it.

If the target realm's login page uses a custom Keycloak theme, the field/
button selectors in `auth.setup.ts` (written against Keycloak's default
theme) may need adjusting.

## Smoke Test

`src/smoke.spec.ts` is the one persisted, committed spec in this package — a
harness self-check, not a feature test. It logs in (via `setup`) and asserts
that the app actually loads and renders its masthead. Its job is to answer
"is the harness broken, or is my change broken?" before you spend time
writing a real `scratch/` spec: if the smoke test fails, the problem is
almost certainly auth, config, or environment — not the change you're trying
to verify.

It runs automatically as part of `pnpm playwright` (and standalone via `pnpm
--filter @osac/playwright exec playwright test --project=smoke`). Unlike
`scratch/` specs, do not delete or repurpose it, and do not add more specs
here — this package still isn't a test suite; one fixed sanity check is the
exception, not a precedent.

## Writing a test

**This is not a test suite.** Beyond the one smoke test above, this package
provides the harness (auth + config) only. Test specs are throwaway, written
ad hoc for a specific manual-verification task (typically by an AI agent
working through a change) and run once, then discarded.

Specs live under `scratch/` — a gitignored directory that only exists on your
machine, so nothing written there is ever committed or lands in a PR. Gitignore
only keeps it out of git, though — `pnpm playwright` re-runs every spec still
in the directory, so delete a spec once you're done with it. Do not write
specs under `src/` (that's reserved for the harness and the smoke test), and
do not treat anything under `scratch/` as regression coverage — this harness
has no CI and nothing under `scratch/` is ever committed.

```bash
mkdir -p apps/playwright/scratch
cat > apps/playwright/scratch/check.spec.ts <<'EOF'
import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';

test('loads the authenticated dashboard', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Account menu' })).toBeVisible();
});
EOF
```

It runs in the `chromium` project — already authenticated via `auth.setup.ts`,
no need to handle login in the test itself. Run it with:

```bash
export OSAC_UI_BASE_URL=... OSAC_USERNAME=...
read -rs OSAC_PASSWORD && export OSAC_PASSWORD
pnpm playwright
```

`pnpm playwright` runs every spec under `scratch/` — delete the file when
you're done with it. Gitignore keeps it out of git either way, but it does
not stop Playwright from finding and re-running a stale spec next time.
