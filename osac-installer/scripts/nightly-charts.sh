    # process termination, potentially long after this function (and its
    # local scope) has already returned. A single-quoted trap referencing
    # the variable by name hits "unbound variable" under set -u at that
    # point -- confirmed live, after this exact function otherwise ran
    # correctly end to end.
    #
    # Shell-escaped via printf %q, not hand-wrapped in single quotes --
