# OSAC

This is the mono-repo for the [Open Sovereign AI Cloud (OSAC)](https://github.com/osac-project)
project. It hosts multiple components as subdirectories, each retaining its own
documentation:

- **[fulfillment-service/](fulfillment-service/README.md)** — a gRPC server (with REST gateway)
  that manages infrastructure resources such as clusters, hosts, compute instances, and
  networking. It uses PostgreSQL for storage and OPA for authorization, and ships an `osac` CLI
  alongside the service binary.
- **[osac-operator/](osac-operator/README.md)** — a Kubernetes operator that reconciles the
  custom resources created by the fulfillment service (or elsewhere), such as `ClusterOrder`,
  `ComputeInstance`, `Tenant`, `VirtualNetwork`, `Subnet`, and `SecurityGroup`. It provisions
  infrastructure via Ansible Automation Platform and includes a console proxy for KubeVirt VM
  console/VNC access.
- **[osac-aap/](osac-aap/README.md)** — the Ansible automation layer: playbooks, roles, and
  collections that provision and manage infrastructure resources (networking, compute,
  bare-metal hosts, OpenShift clusters) when triggered by osac-operator via Ansible Automation
  Platform (AAP).
- **[osac-csi-driver/](osac-csi-driver/README.md)** — an aggregating CSI meta-driver that
  presents a single CSI identity to Kubernetes and routes storage requests to vendor-specific
  CSI drivers (NetApp Trident, VAST, Pure Storage) based on storage tier resolution from the
  fulfillment service.

See each subdirectory's `README.md` (and `docs/`, where present) for setup, build, test, and
deployment instructions specific to that component. This repo's top-level
**[docs/](docs/README.md)** holds both hand-trimmed cross-component architecture and
conventions content and the broader project-level documentation (features, architecture
guides, admin/developer guides — formerly the separate `osac-project/docs` repo, merged
in with its full commit history).

## Verifying container image signatures

Container images published to `ghcr.io/osac-project/*` from this repo's GitHub
Actions workflows are signed keylessly with [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/),
using each workflow run's GitHub Actions OIDC identity via Fulcio/Rekor — no
long-lived private key is involved. Images are signed both from ordinary
pushes to `main` and from component-scoped release tags; the certificate
identity's workflow filename and ref reflect whichever build produced the
image, so pin both rather than accepting any workflow or any tag in this repo:

| Component (+ manifest image, where built) | Image                                 | Workflow file                             | Release tag prefix                |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| osac-operator                               | `osac-project/osac-operator`           | `build-image.yaml`                          | `osac-operator`                    |
| fulfillment-service                         | `osac-project/fulfillment-service`     | `publish-image.yaml`                        | `fulfillment-service`              |
| bare-metal-fulfillment-operator             | `osac-project/bare-metal-fulfillment-operator` | `build-bmf-image.yaml`              | `bare-metal-fulfillment-operator`  |
| osac-aap                                    | `osac-project/osac-aap`                | `execution-environment.yml`                 | `osac-aap`                         |
| metering-service                            | `osac-project/metering-service`        | `build-metering-service-image.yaml`         | `osac-metering`                    |
| metering-m360-adapter                       | `osac-project/metering-m360-adapter`   | `build-metering-m360-adapter-image.yaml`    | `osac-metering`                    |
| metering-echo-adapter                       | `osac-project/metering-echo-adapter`   | `build-metering-echo-adapter-image.yaml`    | `osac-metering`                    |
| osac-csi-driver                             | `osac-project/osac-csi-driver`         | `publish-csi-driver-image.yaml`             | `osac-csi-driver`                  |

`nightly-build.yaml` always rebuilds and republishes every image above as
part of its nightly run. `osac-release.yaml` only rebuilds and republishes
images whose components are actually selected for rebuilding (named in
that release's `component_versions`, and not already published at the
requested version) — every other component is pinned to its existing
published image, untouched, not resigned. Both call into the same shared
`osac-build-and-publish.yaml` reusable workflow whenever a rebuild does
happen, so `osac-build-and-publish.yaml@refs/heads/main` is the one
signer identity that covers either case, for any image in this table —
not just the workflow listed. Signing isn't skipped for an already-signed
digest: every run signs whatever digest it pushes, even when a rebuild is
byte-identical to an already-published one, so that digest ends up with more
than one valid signature from different identities rather than only the
newest. A manual dispatch against a non-`main` ref signs under that ref's
identity instead (the reusable workflow call follows whatever ref
`nightly-build.yaml`/`osac-release.yaml` were themselves dispatched
against) — match the regex to the ref actually used if you dispatched it
yourself.

Verify an image, substituting the workflow file and tag prefix from the table above:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/osac-project/osac/\.github/workflows/<workflow-file>@refs/(heads/main|tags/<tag-prefix>/.+)$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/<image>@sha256:<digest>
```

For example, to verify an osac-operator image:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/osac-project/osac/\.github/workflows/build-image\.yaml@refs/(heads/main|tags/osac-operator/.+)$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/osac-project/osac-operator@sha256:<digest>
```

To verify an image instead produced by a nightly run or a release
dispatched from `main` (the common case) — e.g. a metering-echo-adapter
image:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/osac-project/osac/\.github/workflows/osac-build-and-publish\.yaml@refs/heads/main$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/osac-project/metering-echo-adapter@sha256:<digest>
```

If `nightly-build.yaml`/`osac-release.yaml` was manually dispatched against
a different ref, replace `refs/heads/main` above with the exact ref used.
Note that a component's own tag-triggered build (the first example above)
and a nightly/release run can independently produce a byte-identical image
from the same commit — when that happens, both identities may validly have
signed that exact digest. If one identity doesn't verify, check the other
workflow/ref identity before concluding the artifact isn't signed.

## Verifying Helm chart signatures

Helm charts published to `oci://ghcr.io/osac-project/charts/*` are signed the
same way. Every chart here — every mono-repo component's sub-chart and the
`osac` umbrella chart itself — is packaged, pushed, and signed by
`osac-build-and-publish.yaml`, as part of a nightly run or a real release
(`nightly-build.yaml`/`osac-release.yaml` both call into that same shared
reusable workflow to do so). There is no other publisher for any chart in
this registry.

`helm pull`/`helm push` print the artifact's digest directly, so no extra
tooling is needed to resolve it:

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/osac-project/charts/<chart-name> --version <version>
# Digest: sha256:<digest>

cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/osac-project/osac/\.github/workflows/osac-build-and-publish\.yaml@refs/.+$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/osac-project/charts/<chart-name>@sha256:<digest>
```

The identity accepts any ref (not pinned to `refs/heads/main`), since a
nightly run or a manually dispatched release can run from a different
branch or tag.

The umbrella chart (`osac`) only ever has one signer identity —
`osac-build-and-publish.yaml`. For a normal nightly run or a release
dispatched from `main` (the common case), verify with just:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/osac-project/osac/\.github/workflows/osac-build-and-publish\.yaml@refs/heads/main$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/osac-project/charts/osac@sha256:<digest>
```

If `osac-release.yaml` was manually dispatched against a different ref
(GitHub's "Use workflow from" selector), the signature carries that ref
instead — replace `refs/heads/main` above with the exact ref actually used
(e.g. `refs/heads/<branch>`).

Always verify by digest (`@sha256:...`), not by mutable tag — resolve a tag to
its digest first with `skopeo inspect docker://ghcr.io/osac-project/<component>:<tag>`
if needed. Images pushed to `quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/osac-tenant/...` via
Konflux are signed separately by Konflux's own Enterprise Contract pipeline;
see that pipeline's documentation for verifying those instead.

## Verifying binary signatures

The `osac` CLI and `fulfillment-service` binaries are released to GitHub
Releases by `publish-binaries.yaml`, triggered on `fulfillment-service/vX.Y.Z`
tags. Each release binary is signed the same keyless way as the images and
charts above; goreleaser's `signs` step produces a single Sigstore bundle
(`<binary>.sigstore.json`, containing both the certificate and signature)
alongside every binary in the release.

Download a binary with its bundle, then verify:

```bash
gh release download fulfillment-service/<version> \
  --repo osac-project/osac \
  --pattern 'osac_<os>_<arch>*'

cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle osac_<os>_<arch>.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/osac-project/osac/\.github/workflows/publish-binaries\.yaml@refs/tags/fulfillment-service/.+$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  osac_<os>_<arch>
```

Substitute `fulfillment-service` for `osac` to verify that binary instead —
both are built and signed from the same release. `<os>`/`<arch>` match the
asset names on the release page (e.g. `osac_Linux_x86_64`).

## Local development with go.work

The root [`go.work`](go.work) file wires all Go modules in the mono-repo —
`fulfillment-service`, `osac-operator` (plus its `api` submodule),
`bare-metal-fulfillment-operator`, `osac-csi-driver`, and the three `osac-metering`
modules (`schema`, `metering-service`, `adapters`) — together as a Go workspace, so
cross-module changes can be built and tested locally without publishing intermediate
versions. Go tooling run from the repo root will automatically use the workspace; no
extra flags are needed.

## AI-assisted development

After clone, run `tools/bootstrap.sh` from this repo root. It vendors
[osac-ai-skills](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-ai-skills) and
[flightctl/ai-workflows](https://github.com/flightctl/ai-workflows), clones
skill-relative sibling repos (see `AGENTS.md`), forks the writeable siblings
to your GitHub account, and links Claude Code / Cursor / Gemini CLI skill
discovery. Requires an authenticated `gh` session unless you pass `--no-fork`.
`--fork-name origin` sets writeable sibling remotes to `origin` = your fork and
`upstream` = osac-project; it does not change this checkout or skill vendor
remotes. `--no-fork` wins over `--fork-name`. After `--fork-name origin`, a
later `--no-fork` run skips updates on those origin-as-fork siblings rather
than calling `gh`. This
repo is the project root. A nested `osac-workspace/osac/` checkout aborts;
use a standalone clone or worktree instead.

The Feature → PRD → Design → Jira sync → Implement → E2E sequence is documented in
[osac-ai-skills](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-ai-skills#recommended-skill-sequence)
(local after bootstrap: `~/.osac-ai-skills/README.md` or
`.osac-ai-skills/README.md`). See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
for bootstrap details and component conventions.

Using OpenAI Codex? See [`docs/codex-getting-started.md`](docs/codex-getting-started.md)
for Codex-specific onboarding (install, `/import`, permissions, trusting the
repo's hooks, and skill discovery under `.agents/skills`).

## Distrobox (Linux/x86_64)

Requires [podman](https://podman.io/) and [distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) on Linux. Image tool binaries are x86_64 only. From this repo root:

```bash
make enter                     # Build image and enter
make claude                    # Run Claude Code inside the distrobox
make status
make rebuild
```

The image lives in `tools/distrobox/`. It shares `$HOME` by default (`HOME_DIR` to override).

## Parallel worktrees

```bash
source tools/osac-helpers.sh
osac-new-worktree feat/OSAC-1234
```

Creates `../osac-OSAC-1234` by default (or `$OSAC_WORKTREE_PARENT/osac-OSAC-1234`), checks out the new branch, and runs `tools/bootstrap.sh` (extra args after the branch are forwarded, e.g. `--no-fork` or `--fork-name origin`). Remove with `git worktree remove` on that path from the original clone.
