# OSAC operator

Kubernetes controllers for OSAC resources, provisioning through AAP, feedback
to the fulfillment service, and the KubeVirt console proxy.

This component is part of the OSAC monorepo, not an isolated project. Its APIs,
generated artifacts, deployment configuration, and runtime behavior may affect
other components. Apply the repository-wide rules in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), consider downstream consumers before changing
behavior, and follow the instructions for every affected component.

## Required context

Before changing this component, identify the documents relevant to the change
below, then read and follow them. These documents are authoritative for their
respective areas.

- Component setup and architecture: [`README.md`](README.md)
- Cross-component contracts: [`../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`../docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](../docs/CONVENTIONS.md)
- Controller-specific examples: neighboring files in `internal/controller/`
- API consumer changes: [`../fulfillment-service/AGENTS.md`](../fulfillment-service/AGENTS.md)

## Invariants

- Resource controllers generally own provisioning, finalizers, and lifecycle status; feedback controllers synchronize state with the fulfillment service.
- Every resource controller except `tenant_controller.go` must skip reconciliation when `osac.openshift.io/management-state` is `Unmanaged`.
- `StorageReconciler` is an intentional exception to the dual-controller pattern: it reconciles Tenant storage and does not own a separate CRD.
- Preserve tenant namespace isolation and established predicates when creating or watching resources.
- When changing shared controller behavior, inspect every controller using the same lifecycle.
- `pkg/provisioning`, `pkg/aap`, and `pkg/dispatcher` have external consumers, including the bare-metal fulfillment operator; interface changes are cross-component changes.
- When debugging operators, check for stale `vendor/` dependencies and cached images before rebuilding.
- The fulfillment proto types are the shared top-level `proto/` module, imported as `github.com/osac-project/osac/proto/gen/...`. This component no longer generates its own copy.
- Never put credentials in logs, samples, or manifests.

## Generated files

- After changing `api/v1alpha1/*_types.go`, run `make manifests generate`.
- Then run `make helm-crds` to synchronize `config/crd/` with `charts/operator-crds/`; use `make check-helm-crds` to verify the result.
- Fulfillment proto changes are regenerated once in the shared module: `make -C ../proto generate` (see `proto/AGENTS.md`). Do not regenerate anything proto-related from `osac-operator/`.
- Never hand-edit `config/crd/`, `zz_generated.deepcopy.go`, or `go.sum`; run `go mod tidy` for module changes.

## Integration Testing

See [suite boundaries and coverage gaps](../docs/INTEGRATION-TESTING.md#osac-operator).

| Touched area | Required validation | Command / follow-up |
|---|---|---|
| Pure helpers, validation, or state calculations | Unit | `make test` |
| Controller reconciliation, finalizers, status, or CRD interactions | Envtest | `make test` |
| Controller deployment, watches, RBAC, console proxy, networking, or Helm wiring | Component integration | Deploy current image/manifests, then `make integration-tests`; [installer alternative](../docs/INTEGRATION-TESTING.md#osac-operator) |
| AAP, dispatcher, provisioning-provider, KubeVirt, or fulfillment boundary | Qualifying Contract or E2E | Use a boundary-specific suite; follow [OSAC-4843](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-4843) when coverage is missing |
| Generated CRDs or manifests | Envtest plus applicable Kind suite | `make manifests generate helm-crds check-helm-crds`, then the required test command |

Envtest runs via `make test`; Kind tests require the current operator deployment.

## Validation

From `osac-operator/`:

```bash
make fmt
make lint
make test
make helm-lint
make check-helm-crds
make integration-tests       # Requires a pre-existing Kind cluster
```

`make build` also runs the unit-test path. The console proxy integration tests
are under `test/integration/`; E2E suites are under [`../tests/e2e/`](../tests/e2e/).
